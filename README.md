DSA Final Project

We plan on having lots of customers. We need our employees to be able to add customers. Each
customer has a phone number, first name and last name.

We also plan on having lots of videos of course! We need a way for employees to add videos. For
each video, we have a barcode (exactly 12 digits) and the title of the movie. For instance Star Wars

People can take out movies. When they do, we just want to type their phone number and the movie
barcode number. Someone can take out more than 1 movie, but not more than 3. Obviously people
can not take out a movie we do not have or someone else has already taken out!
When people return movies, we just want to type in their phone number and the bar code. Please
double check they actually had that movie out.

We want to be able to type the name of a movie and then find out who has it rented right now. For
instance, I should just type “star wars” and it should show me the information of who has it so I can
